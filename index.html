        <p class="content">My name's Andrew.  I'm a software developer who
           came to the industry from the exciting world of Emergency Medical
            Services where I worked as a Paramedic for 7 interesting years.
            Complicated problems are my favorite kind, especially if they force
            me to learn new techniques to solve them.  When there's no project on
            deck, I can be found just about anywhere out and about looking around
            and meeting interesting people.  If you'd like to talk, my contact
            information is below.  Always happy to help with a problem, teach, or just
            grab lunch and chat.
        </p>
  Hello, World.
