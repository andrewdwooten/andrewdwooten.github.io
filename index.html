        <p class="content">My name's Andrew. I'm a software developer who
           came to the industry from the exciting world of Emergency Medical
            Services where I worked as a Paramedic for 7 interesting years.
            The transition to attending the Turing Schools Back End program was
            intimidating at times, but there's not a thing I would change about
            the experience.

            Complicated problems are my favorite kind, especially if they let
            me to learn new techniques to solve them. When there's no project on
            deck, I can be found just about anywhere out and about looking around
            and meeting interesting people. If you'd like to talk, my contact
            information is above. Always happy to help with a problem, teach, or just
            grab lunch and chat.
