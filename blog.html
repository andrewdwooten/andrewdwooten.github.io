      <h3 id="title"> Reflections on Module 1 at Turing</h3>
      <p>  One can only prepare for something to such a degree.  After that
        life comes chock-full of fun and not-so-fun surprises. I did my best to get 
        ready for my first Module with Turing: completed the pre-work, made sure my 
        affairs were in order, moved cross-country, all that Turing stuff. Most of all
        I came in ready to feel unprepared and uncomfortable.</p>

       <p> For all of the work I put in, that last thing was the best preparation I had
        for my Mod one experience. For a solid 6 weeks, Turing pushed me past what I 
        thought was my breaking point. There were many times where I questioned all the 
        decision that got me to Turing. Was this right for me? Can I keep up with such 
        an epic workload? How much more can possibly be put on my plate? Why won't this
        work?!</p> 

        <p>This is the best thing I've ever done. Did I doubt myself at times? Definitely; 
        I think that's to be expected all things considered.
        Never have I grown or been more satisfied with what I'm doing than during my time
        thusfar at Turing. I'm learning to do the stuff I've dreamt about for years.
        It's just a silly Battleship game. Yea, but I made it, and it works!! The utter
        glee I feel in working through a problem and finding the solution is truly indescribable.
        The logic and somewhat stern nature of development are some of my favorite things. I
        couldn't be happier doing anything else.</p>

        <p>Besides how much I'm learning, the best thing I took away from Mod 1 was coming
          to terms with the Turing Community. It's a group of people ready and willing at 
          the drop of a hat to help someone with a problem. It was pretty hard to adjust to
          the idea actually. All these people will talk to ya and help ya out? I wasn't 
          at all ready for that, and it took adjusting to get comfortable with the idea.
          I'm still profoundly impressed with the people I get to work with, and I feel 
          extremely fortunate to get to do so. If it wasn't for the people, Turing wouldn't
          be Turing.  I'm delighted to be here; although, slightly anxious about Mod2. Should
          be good times though. :)</p>
