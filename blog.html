      <h3 id="title"> Reflections on Module 1 at Turing</h3>
      <p>  One can only prepare for something to such a degree.  After that
        life comes chock-full of fun and not-so-fun surprises. I did my best to get 
        ready for my first Module with Turing: completed the pre-work, made sure my 
        affairs were in order, moved cross-country, all that Turing stuff. Most of all
        I came in ready to feel unprepared and uncomfortable.</p>

       <p> For all of the work I put in, that last thing was the best preparation I had
        for my Mod one experience. For a solid 6 weeks, Turing pushed me past what I 
        thought was my breaking point. There were many times where I questioned all the 
        decision that got me to Turing. Was this right for me? Can I keep up with such 
        an epic workload? How much more can possibly be put on my plate?</p> 

        <p>This is the best thing I've ever done. Did I crack a little at times? Definitely; 
        I think that's to be expected and is relatively healthy all things considered.
        Never have I grown or been more satisfied with what I'm doing than during my time
        thusfar at Turing. I'm learning to do the stuff I've dreamt about for years.
        It's just a silly Battleship game. Yea, but I made it, and it works!! The utter
        glee I feel in working through a problem and finding the solution is indescribable.</p>
