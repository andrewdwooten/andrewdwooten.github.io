      <h3 id="title"> Reflections on Module 1 at Turing</h3>
      <p>  One can only prepare for something to such a degree.  After that
        life comes chock-full of fun and not-so-fun surprises. I did my best to get
        ready for my first Module with Turing: completed the pre-work, made sure my
        affairs were in order, moved cross-country, all that Turing stuff. Most of all
        I came in ready to feel unprepared and uncomfortable.</p>

       <p> For all of the work I put in, that last thing was the best preparation I had
        for my Mod one experience. For a solid 6 weeks, Turing pushed me past what I
        thought was my breaking point. There were many times where I questioned all the
        decision that got me to Turing. Was this right for me? Can I keep up with such
        an epic workload? How much more can possibly be put on my plate? Why won't this
        work?!</p>

        <p>This is the best thing I've ever done. Did I doubt myself at times? Definitely;
        I think that's to be expected all things considered.
        Never have I grown or been more satisfied with what I'm doing than during my time
        thusfar at Turing. I'm learning to do the stuff I've dreamt about for years.
        It's just a silly Battleship game. Yea, but I made it, and it works!! The utter
        glee I feel in working through a problem and finding the solution is truly indescribable.
        The logic and somewhat stern nature of development are some of my favorite things. I
        couldn't be happier doing anything else.</p>

        <p>Besides how much I'm learning, the best thing I took away from Mod 1 was coming
          to terms with the Turing Community. It's a group of people ready and willing at
          the drop of a hat to help someone with a problem. It was pretty hard to adjust to
          the idea actually. All these people will talk to ya and help ya out? I wasn't
          at all ready for that, and it took adjusting to get comfortable with the idea.
          I'm still profoundly impressed with the people I get to work with, and I feel
          extremely fortunate to get to do so. If it wasn't for the people, Turing wouldn't
          be Turing.  I'm delighted to be here; although, slightly anxious about Mod2. Should
          be good times though. :)</p>



        <h3 id="title"> My Favorite Technical Concept</h3>
        <p>I've learned an epic amount of stuff in Mod 1. I suppose if I had to land on one
          thing in particular that really struck a chord with me it would be Test Driven
          Development. I'm a fairly obsessive and precise person by nature, and there's a large
          part of me that really enjoys the methodology of breaking down the problem/solution
          and writing out tests to proof the pieces individually and then in integration with
          everything else. It's cool stuff!</p>
        <p>Additionally, testing serves as a way to throttle my enthusiasm. I love writing code,
          and that can be trouble when it gets me down a rabbit hole of a dozen untested methods
          which <em>should</em> work. Testing serves as a set of brakes for me.  It keeps me
          thinking methodically and working at a pace and in a way that prevents me needing to
          go back to fix a bad chain of events. It's a great tool and method for keeping on track.</p>
        <p>In the realm of random things, it's alsoincredibly gratifying to look at the bottom of
          the test report and see all of them passing and that every line of code was covered. I
          mentally, sometimes verbally, insert a superhero sound effect when that point gets reached.
          "This is definitely probably going to work most of the time...what's next?"</p>


        <h3 id="title">Helpful Tricks for Workflow 03/05/2016</h3>
          <p>I'm a pretty compartmentalized person by nature. I'm not a big fan of searching
          all over the place for the things I'm looking for or, more particularly, what I'm
          working on. Learning appropriate techniques for workflow has been a decent challenge
          for me, but I'm going to pass on a few tips that have helped me out immensely.</p>
          <p>I use Atom as my text editor. I made the switch several weeks ago after dealing
          with a lot of arguments with VS Code. There's a lot of learning that has to happen
          in getting comfortable with your tools as a developer, and I think that developing
          a system for performing your work is definitely in there. I was encouraged early on
          as a student to find ways to keep my hands on the keyboard as much as possible; the
          trackpad is the enemy of productivity it seems. A lot of people seem to favor using
          Spectacle to resize any number of windows so that they can be viewed simultaneously.
          To each their own, but that intrinsically just irks me in my personal workstyle, and
          it's not something that I gravitated towards.</p>
          <p> I found a workflow system that fit me better. At any given time when I'm working
          I've got three windows open: two web browsers and my Atom window. One browser is
          dedicated to a tab that has my local server running so I can actively view my project;
          it's responsibilities also include open tabs for my Waffle board, the GitHub repo in
          in question, and my original assignment. The second web browser is dedicated to research;
          that is to say it's my Google sandbox for finding solutions to a problem at hand; it
          also has a number of my standard doc references open at any given time. There's no
          cross-over between these two; personally I find that this system saves me time when
          I'm looking for something in particular. Bouncing between multiple browser windows
          searching for a single tab is really a timesuck after a while if you don't have a system.</p>
          <p>Now, I happily utilize multiple desktops. Atom is flanked by my workflow browser
          and by my research browser. I've found this to be crucial in that when I'm working in
          my editor, all of my focus is there. Atom is full-screened and is incredibly easy to
          view and work in. What about my terminal? Well, some kind souls developed a great
          package for Atom called Platformio IDE Terminal. Essentially, it's an in-window terminal
          package for Atom. ctrl-tilde will show your last used terminal. cmd-shift-t will open
          another terminal for you to work in. cmd-shift-j and cmd-shift-k allow you to cycle
          left and right, respectively through your terminal tabs. They're their when I need them,
          but otherwise they chill, minimized, in the bottom of my Atom window.</p>
          <p>As with my web browsers, there's some organization that happens here also. The
             terminal tabs can be found running on my machine when I have work in
             progress. Tab one is dedicated to running my rails server. It justs sits
             there and waits to be restarted every so often. Tab two is my rails console, tux
             session, or a pry session. Having a sandbox at the ready saves time; thoughts/ideas
             can be fleeting, and I've found that having this tool at the ready saves that
             dreadful moment when you forget your idea, and you're smoldering slightly while
             waiting for your sandbox to pull up. A couple of keystokes, and it's there to
             fiddle around with. The last terminal tab that I run is my most active
             one; it's where I'm running testing and, in the case of rails at least, generating
             my models, migrations, etc. Big picture: run test, read error, close terminal tab(or
             leave open if it's a simple fix), write some code, re-run tests.</p>
          <p>This is a system that I developed because it's what works best for me. Everything
             has a place and, at any time, is available for full-screen viewing with zero lag
             time. I doubt that I'm the only person in the community that despises multiple
             oddly-sized windows cluttering up my display and making it more difficult to
             get on with my work. Ultimately personal workflow is just that, personal. Find a
             system that works best for you. Experiment with some packages/extensions, and if
             you don't like them then ditch them and keep looking. It took a bit for me to
             find a system that works well for me, but work is better with it in place rather
             than fumbling around my machine looking for things or doing what everyone
             else swears by when it doesn't work for me. If this system helps you out, great!
             I'm happy to have made life a little easier for you. If not, keep looking and
             trying things out until you have something it place that works for you.
             Best of luck!
