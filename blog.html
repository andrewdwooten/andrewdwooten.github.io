      <h3 id="title"> Reflections on Module 1 at Turing</h3>
      <p>  One can only prepare for something to such a degree.  After that
        life comes chock-full of fun and not-so-fun surprises. I did my best to get 
        ready for my first Module with Turing: completed the pre-work, made sure my 
        affairs were in order, moved cross-country, all that Turing stuff. Most of all
        I came in ready to feel unprepared and uncomfortable.</p>

       <p> For all of the work I put in, that last thing was the best preparation I had
        for my Mod one experience. For a solid 6 weeks, Turing pushed me past what I 
        thought was my breaking point. There were many times where I questioned all the 
        decision that got me to Turing. Was this right for me? Can I keep up with such 
        an epic workload? How much more can possibly be put on my plate? Why won't this
        work?!</p> 

        <p>This is the best thing I've ever done. Did I doubt myself at times? Definitely; 
        I think that's to be expected all things considered.
        Never have I grown or been more satisfied with what I'm doing than during my time
        thusfar at Turing. I'm learning to do the stuff I've dreamt about for years.
        It's just a silly Battleship game. Yea, but I made it, and it works!! The utter
        glee I feel in working through a problem and finding the solution is truly indescribable.
        The logic and somewhat stern nature of development are some of my favorite things. I
        couldn't be happier doing anything else.</p>

        <p>Besides how much I'm learning, the best thing I took away from Mod 1 was coming
          to terms with the Turing Community. It's a group of people ready and willing at 
          the drop of a hat to help someone with a problem. It was pretty hard to adjust to
          the idea actually. All these people will talk to ya and help ya out? I wasn't 
          at all ready for that, and it took adjusting to get comfortable with the idea.
          I'm still profoundly impressed with the people I get to work with, and I feel 
          extremely fortunate to get to do so. If it wasn't for the people, Turing wouldn't
          be Turing.  I'm delighted to be here; although, slightly anxious about Mod2. Should
          be good times though. :)</p>
        <h3 id="title"> My Favorite Technical Concept</h3>
        <p>I've learned an epic amount of stuff in Mod 1. I suppose if I had to land on one
          thing in particular that really struck a chord with me it would be Test Driven 
          Development. I'm a fairly obsessive and precise person by nature, and there's a large
          part of me that really enjoys the methodology of breaking down the problem/solution
          and writing out tests to proof the pieces individually and then in integration with 
          everything else. It's cool stuff!</p>
        <p>Additionally, testing serves as a way to throttle my enthusiasm. I love writing code,
          and that can be trouble when it gets me down a rabbit hole of a dozen untested methods
          which <em>should</em> work. Testing serves as a set of brakes for me.  It keeps me
          thinking methodically and working at a pace and in a way that prevents me needing to
          go back to fix a bad chain of events. It's a great tool and method for keeping on track.</p>
        <p>In the realm of random things, it's alsoincredibly gratifying to look at the bottom of 
          the test report and see all of them passing and that every line of code was covered. I 
          mentally, sometimes verbally, insert a superhero sound effect when that point gets reached.
          "This is definitely probably going to work most of the time...what's next?"</p>
